This section documents **practical protection engineering knowledge**
developed from real EHV/HV system experience—covering design logic,
settings philosophy, commissioning realities, and operational behavior.

The focus is on **why a protection scheme works (or fails)** in real grids,
not just how it is described in standards or textbooks.

## Core Protection Topics

### Line Protection
- Distance Protection (Zone philosophy, reach setting logic)
- Line Differential Protection
- Communication-assisted schemes (POTT, PUTT, DCB)

### Transformer Protection
- Differential protection fundamentals
- Inrush, overfluxing, and restraint logic
- Backup protection philosophy

### Busbar Protection
- High-impedance vs Low-impedance schemes
- CT selection and saturation issues
- Stability vs sensitivity trade-offs

### Feeder & Backup Protection
- Overcurrent and earth-fault protection
- Coordination philosophy
- Grid backup requirements

---

## Substation Automation & Communication

- IEC 61850 basics (process bus, station bus)
- GOOSE messaging – myths vs reality
- Protection IED integration with SAS / SCADA
- Time synchronization and its importance

---

## Engineering Perspective Emphasis

Each topic will address:
- How protection is **actually applied** in utility systems
- Common design and commissioning mistakes
- Coordination issues between protection, operation, and communication
- Lessons learned from field failures and misoperations

This section is intended for **working protection engineers**, not only students.
