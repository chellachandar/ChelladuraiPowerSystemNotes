This section hosts **browser-based power system engineering tools**
developed to support **quick checks, learning, and field verification**.

All tools are:
- Lightweight and fast
- Fully client-side (no server required)
- Designed from a **utility engineering perspective**
- Intended to support—not replace—engineering judgment

## Available Tools

### 🔧 Per-Unit Converter
Convert actual electrical quantities into per-unit values using
custom base MVA and base kV.

**Status:** Planned

---

### 🔧 Distance Relay Reach Calculator
Estimate Zone-1, Zone-2, and Zone-3 reach based on line impedance
and protection philosophy.

**Status:** Planned

## Planned Enhancements
- Graphical visualization of relay zones
- Short-circuit level estimator
- CT saturation check utility
- Load flow concept demonstrator

Each tool will be accompanied by:
- Engineering background
- Assumptions used
- Practical interpretation of results
