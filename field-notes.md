This section documents **real-world engineering experiences**
from power system projects, grid operations, protection commissioning,
and system events.

These notes highlight **what actually happens in the field**—
including constraints, mistakes, coordination challenges, and
lessons that are rarely captured in textbooks or standards.

## What You Will Find Here

- Commissioning challenges and how they were resolved
- Protection misoperations and root-cause insights
- Communication failures and coordination issues
- Operational decisions under time pressure
- Design assumptions that failed in practice
