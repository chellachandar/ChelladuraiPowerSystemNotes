---

This section covers foundational power system concepts explained
from a **utility and grid-operation perspective**, not textbook theory.

## Topics Planned
- Load Flow Analysis (NR, Fast Decoupled)
- Short Circuit Analysis
- Stability Concepts
- Per-Unit System (practical use)

Each topic will focus on:
- Why it matters in real grids
- What software does internally
- Common engineering mistakes
